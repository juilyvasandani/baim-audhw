# BAIM - Analyzing Unstructured Data
Homework submissions for MGMT 590 - Analyzing Unstructured Data.

Instructor: Jinyang Zheng

Course Dates: October - December 2019

Course Description: This course fills in the technical gap between the traditional analysis on structured data and the requirement for more advanced analysis on unstructured data. After taking this course, students are expected to be capable in collecting, processing, and analyzing online unstructured data using mainstream open-sourced software, e.g. Python. Due to the limited time, we take text and image as examples for illustration. The course is formatted as a combination of seminars and hands-on coding practices in class. Students are expected to code and debug in the class.
